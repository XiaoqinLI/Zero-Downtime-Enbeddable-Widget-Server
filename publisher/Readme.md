# The Repo of publisher site.

For now, this is a simple demo site with simple Crimson Luna and Crux decorations that demonstrates the embeddable widgets served from the generator we have been working on.

By default, there is a demo 'physician-card' on the site. To see how it works on your site, please check the Readme file in 'generator repo', 'components/physician-card' directory.

The dockerfile in this repo is just for building a simple nginx server for publisher if needed.
